Although this is a fun little game, I began to lose interest real quick when
I realized I could not go passed Level 9. I was little dissappointed.
### How to Play
Set up these for best experience
<br/> 
window size: 49 rows and 177 cols printf \e[8;49;177t 
<br/> font size: 14pt <br/> <br/>
Once you launch the game, press any key to start. 
Pattern will be displayed based on your level.
Level 1 will display a pattern with length 1. The challenge is 
to input the displayed pattern correctly. Once you
successfully recall the pattern, you move on to the next level.
If not, you start all over. Notice that your score is your level. 

### Features
- Shows your best score
- Shows your current score
- Colorful feedback
### Observation
The project was less tricky than I thought it would be. I liked how it
turned out. Although project would definitely benefit from little bit of
simplification. It does overcomplicate simple concepts. The is really lowers
flexibility. Most of the locations where certain messages appear were hardcoded,
which is was not really the goal.
